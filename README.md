# Introduction 
This project is an extension to the SPMeta2 library. 
At the moment the project allows you to deploy nintex forms to the SP2013 on prem. I am sure 2016 should work too but it has not been specificly tested.

# Getting Started
Look into the SPMeta2.NintexExt.CSOM.SP13.Test program for the sample of how you can use the package to deploy a nintex form. 
Onprovisioning/Onprovisioned code is optional.

# Build and Test
Build the projects, this would be enough :).
